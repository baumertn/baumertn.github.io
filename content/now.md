<!-- ## Adventure -->

<!-- ## Music -->

## Reading
- _The Sense of an Ending_ – Julian Barnes

For a complete list of what I've been reading check out the [library](/library).

## Software
- Exploring [Exlixir](https://exlixir.com/) with [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) for web development. Very early stages, though!

<!-- ## Tech -->

## Writing
- Just published my short article about taking ownership of my music collection: [Take Ownership of Music by Cutting the "Streaming Cord"](/posts/take-ownership-music/).
- Building a system with _Cortex Prime_ to replace our very irregular _Pathfinder 2e_ campaign in the hopes that a simpler system will make it easier to play.
