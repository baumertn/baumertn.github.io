<!--## Adventure-->
## Music
- I am trying to expand my musical palette. I lazily let ChatGPT generate me lists of the Top 10 albums per genre – larger genres only. Currently, I'm _activly_ listening to hip-hop, which I haven't really listened to since I was a kid.

## Reading
- _The Burnout Society_ – Byung-Chul Han
- _On Love_ – Stendhal (Available on [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53720))

## Software
- Improving my GO skills by building some internal company tooling
- Dipping my toes into agent-based simulation.

## Writing
- I'm currently doing some preliminary world-building for a soft-low-magic world. Might become a book?
