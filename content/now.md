<!--## Adventure-->
## Music
- "Cutting the cord". Migrating from streaming to owning my music collection once again.

## Reading
- _Made in Abyss_ – Tsukushi Akihito.

For a complete list of what I've been reading check out the [library](/library).

## Software
- Exploring [Exlixir](https://exlixir.com/) with [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) for web development. Very early stages, though!
- With the end of Windows 10 support and the holidays coming up, I'm going to set up openSUSE Tumbleweed on my gaming PC.

## Writing
- "Writing" my first Pathfinder 2e adventure. Mostly some prep, not a lot of writing.
- Penning down some story ideas/inspirations.
