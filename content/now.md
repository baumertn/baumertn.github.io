<!--## Adventure-->
<!-- ## Music -->

## Reading
- _Dostoevsky: A Writer in His Time_ â€“ Joseph Frank. I want to read some of Dostoevsky's work and thought knowing more about him and his
circumstances could be helpful in understanding the work.

For a complete list of what I've been reading check out the [library](/library).

<!-- ## Software -->

## Writing
- "Writing" my first Pathfinder 2e adventure. Mostly some prep, not a lot of writing.
- Penning down some story ideas/inspirations.
