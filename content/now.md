<!--## Adventure-->
## Music
- I am trying to expand my musical palette. I lazily let ChatGPT generate me lists of the Top 10 albums per genre – larger genres only.
  Currently, I'm _activly_ listening to Electornic.

## Reading
- _The Burnout Society_ – Byung-Chul Han

For a complete list of what I've been reading check out the [library](/library).

## Software
- Improving my GO skills by building some internal company tooling
- Dipping my toes into agent-based simulation.

## Writing
- I'm currently doing some preliminary world-building for a soft-low-magic world. Might become a book?
