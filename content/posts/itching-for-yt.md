A few weeks ago I decided to replace some of my consumption-based habits with more "productive", creative rewarding habits.

One of the habits I want to drop is spending so much time on YouTube.
I haven't watched YouTube in just _four_ consecutive days and I get "itches" to do so.

Is this how addicts feel? I hope not, because that would be pathetic for me.

I can't believe that a stupid _website_ makes me feel like that at all.
But it does show me, that this was the right decision to make.
