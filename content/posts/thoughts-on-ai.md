- The tech is pretty cool. Computers being able to parse written text and "comprehend" it is amazing.
- Usage of AI seems weird to me.
  - Coding: Feels "okay" for web, particularly frontend. Tried it a few times with Ansible, where it sometimes helped othertimes it lead to spending more time.
  - Creative arts: It's fun to use it for memes or some such between friends. But comercilizing that feels off. Any why is there such a big push here?
  - Other fields: Not really my expertise. Hard to judge.
- It seems to me that outsourcing whole tasks to AI is just not working sufficiently well. See the companies that tried to move customer service to AI only.
  - RE: Customer service – I think it could make sense to use AI to assist a customer service rep in a conversation with, for example, assesments of client sentiment.
    But then again, it's not my field. So maybe that's just the skill that a rep should have to learn?
- My usage has become limited.
  - Coding: I use [Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/) in Neovim. But just as an advanced autocomplete. I do enjoy it for error messages, particularly in Go.
  - "Research": I do use ChatGPT to reserach topics. Similarly, how I previously would have used Google to just look something up. This is probably more a sign of how bad search engines and messed up SEO has become.
  - Image generation: As stated above, mostly just for funny pictures to friends. Very rarely.
- Financial situation: Crazy. So much money. How are they ever going to have profits that high? Sure, _if_ AGI were to happen, maybe. But the behaviour of these companies does not fill me with confidence in that regard.
  - nvidia is probably going to be the only real winner in all of that. As they were in the crypto hype as well.
    - I probably will not by an nvidia GPU again as long as Jensen is CEO.
- Fears of replacement:
  - I'm currently not feeling afraid as an engineer.
  - Some have been layed off, that sucks.
  - If you are afraid, you might want to look into the trades. Physical labor seems to be a task not that easily replaceable.
  - Keep your creativity up artists. Yes, it sucks to no longer be able to pay the bills with it, but I hope you can keep the passion. I for one still appreciate it.
