This site is going to be the main hub to put my thoughts out. Topics might range from what I'm up to (see [/now](/now)),
tech I find interesting, might be researching, or trying out – hick-ups and failures included, new things I learn about photography, writing – of course – and other small nuggets
of miscellaneous [things I learned (today)](/tags/today-i-learned/).
