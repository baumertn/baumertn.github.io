In this article I'm going to outline how I'm taking ownership of my music collection again.

First I'm going to give my personal motivations for why I'm even doing this.

In [Step 0](#step-0-create-a-quick-backup) I'm going to outline how I have created a quick "backup" of my music collection to be able to cancel my subscription.

I then tell you in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-plan) how I have created a plan for building the music collection.

In [Step 2](#step-2-buying) I'm showing you where I buy my music with recommendations in order of my preference.

Then we'll go into the parts of my systemd that I'm still working on. Starting with [Step 3](#step-3-organizing), where I'll show you how I'm organizing my local music.

And finally in [Step 4](#step-4-enjoying) I'll give you some software recommendations.

## Motivation

Stop me if you have heard it before, but the big companies want you to not own things anymore.
Subscription this, subscription that. Oh, that toaster? Well of course it has a subscription as well!

Why take ownership of your music though, are there no other areas that are more important?
There definitely are. But I realized that I'm spending nearly 160€ per year on music streaming and most artists but the biggest acts are struggling.

Something is off.

I've used Spotify nearly since it became available in Germany (anyone remember the gray UI?). But buy late 2022, early 2023 I was very unhappy with the service.
Pushing more and more podcasts that I didn't care for. Then my discovery playlists got filled with music of artists that I didn't know but had a massive "featuring" list including dozens of artists of which one was a one I followed
(this is, I assume, how I got it recommended). Of course the recommended song was nothing close to what the artist I followed was actually doing.

Given Spotify's stand on AI music it might have become even worse now.

Then I switched to YouTube Music in may of 2023. 11.99€ per month but also having YouTube Premium. Bit more expensive but hey, I'm watching YouTube a lot!
The price was later raised to 12.99€ per month.

I've written previously about [my relatinship with YouTube](/posts/youtube-relationship/) – in short, it makes me waste too much time.
But having my music tied to YouTube ment that I had to be signed into YouTube all the time when I wanted to listen to music. Another hurdle to overcome for me to reduce my time spent on YouTube.

I've also started to listen to whole albums more.

All of this made me me want to own my music again. Curating my own library and playlists can be fun.

This is not the first time I've tried this. I started to purchase CDs from some of my favorite bands. But I couldn't make the transition stick.
But now I have a system that did work for me, though it is still in progress.

If your curious to try it yourself, this is how I'm doing it. Keep in mind that it is not all just positives.

Generally, you will be paying more in the short term, until you've got most of your library. If you are someone who listens to a lot of new music all the time, streaming might stay the best option for you.
If you're like me though, you might only buy a few albums a year it might be worth it to build up your library.

One downside I already felt when I switched to YouTube Music: Spotify does have creat "party" features. Jams etc. which my friends still like to use when we get together.
I'm thinking about building some software to solve this with local music, but I haven't had the time yet.

Last downside, particularly if you have a massive library or space constraint devices: availability.
You might need to self-host your own music streaming server.

But with this all said, let me get started with my system.


## Step 0: Create a quick backup
- Pirate
- Ease the transition. Tried to own before but failed because streaming was still avaiable.
- Ehtically it may be argued against it. If it's a problem, then don't do it.

## Step 1: Create a plan
- Table to list where the music is avaiable for how much
- You don't have to do this if you don't want to
- Might make Qobuz Sublime attractive. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it at all.

## Step 2: Buying
- Mention buying order: bandcamp, Qobuz, iomoio, physical disks, back to the high seas

### bancamp.com
- Great percentage for artists
- Not all music available
- unclear how it works with labels selling on bandcamp
- high quality
- often pay what you want (with minimum price), so you can give more to the artists you like

### Qobuz.com/shop
- Large selection of music
- offers "CD" (standard) and "High" quality.
- Not everything is in high quality
- high quality quite expensive
- Sublime sub might be worht it

### iomoio.com
- _Very_ cheap because they are outside of the US.
- MP3 only. CD quality or lower.
- Quality might not matter to you
- Often offers sales where songs can be as cheap as 0.10 cents.

### Phisical disks
- New disks are similarly priced to high quality albums on Qobuz.
- Used disks are very cheap! But you sometimes have to get lucky, wait for something to be available.
- You need to do the ripping yourself.

### Back to the High Seas
- If I can not find (current) music for a reasonable price, I'll pirate it.
- Example: Only avaiable as CD but not in my country. Import is 80€ or more for a simple CD ⇒ I consider this not reasonably available in my country.
- As before, if you think it's unethical, then don't do it.
- refer back to [Step 0](#step-0-create-a-quick-backup) for one way to do this. Other ways are possible with quick online searches.

## Step 3: Organizing
- Mention beets
- Still very early for myself.

## Step 4: Enjoying
- I just move the songs from my pc to my phone.
- If you have a _massive_ library or you need access to everything all the time (similar to streaming), consider gonic, navidrome, plex or jellyfin.
- recommend Symphonium for Android.
- Mention fooyin for linux. But still exploring options here
