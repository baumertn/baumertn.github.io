This is a collection of all the books that I have read and remembered.
It is a genre mix. Much Fantasy and Sci-fi, but also non-fiction—mostly tech and "self-help".
Also contains a few manga and comics.
Some titles are in German, as I did read them in German.

I have forgotten most of what I read here. Probably.

Fun fact: Playing _The Witcher_  got me into reading as a kid I didn't like it (I played the second _The Witcher_ game first, the original after).

## Finished books
Looking at this list I'm sure you could picture a person. You might consider this person troubled.
You might be right! But I know it's always easier to judge someone else, isn't it?

Most of this data is an export from a now deleted Goodreads account (everything pre 2024). I tried to sort it by finished date.
If I "read" many books on the first of a given month, I most likely added just the month on Goodreads. Might fix it eventually.

Some dates might be off, missing or just plain wrong.
If I did read a book more than once, most likely the first date will be listed.

There was a period of my life where I used Blinkist a lot. I _think_ I noted all cases where I "read" a book through Blinkist.
I did enjoy it a lot more before the whole AI crazy began. I think they replaced most of their readers with AI
and their summaries became worse. I don't have proof, but it's how I felt. I stopped using it completely in late 2024.
