This is a collection of all the books that I have read and remembered.
It is a genre mix. Much Fantasy and Sci-fi, but also non-fiction – mostly tech and "self-help".
Also contains a few manga and comics.
Some titles are in German, as I did read them in German.

I have forgotten most of what I read here. Probably.

Fun fact: Playing _The Witcher 2_ got me into reading. I didn't like it as a kid.

## Reading list
See what I'm currently reading on my [/now page](/now)!

2026-02-19: I've decided to split the list into fiction and non-fiction sections.
Mostly to have an easier time choosing what to read next.

## Finished books
Don't judge me too harshly for the selection of books over the years.

Most of this data is an export from a now deleted _Goodreads_ account (everything pre 2024). I tried to sort it by finished date.
If I "read" many books on the first of a given month, I most likely added just the month on _Goodreads_.

Some dates might be off, missing or just plain wrong.
If I did read a book more than once, most likely the first date will be listed.

There was a period of my life where I used _Blinkist_ a lot. I _think_ I noted all cases where I "read" a book through _Blinkist_.
I did enjoy it a lot more before the whole AI craze began. I think they replaced most of their readers with AI
and their summaries became worse. I don't have proof, but it's how I felt. I stopped using it completely in late 2024.

2025-12-20: I've decided to split the list into sections by year.
